Data needed to run generate_paper_figures_bioRxiv.m

### HCPconnectome_matrices folder
Connectome generated for two subjects and two parcellations (Desikan-Killiany and Destrieux atlases) from the [Human Connectome Project](https://www.humanconnectome.org/) dataset.

### initial conditions folder
100 pre-generated instances of (i) randomly distributed frequency distributions and (ii) node phase initial values.

### network surrogates folder
Connectivity matrices of various network topologies

### networks folder
Functional networks

### paper_simulations folder
All the simulated data used in the paper. Note that matrices corresponding to node phase dynamics have transients removed (converted to NaN) to reduce space.

### others
Connectivity matrices, node locations, between-node distances, pre-calculated network modules
